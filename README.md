Check out [The Ultimate Github Collaboration Guide](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) and [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) for more details.

### Step 1

```
git clone https://github.com/LeoLu0602/boba-chip.git
cd boba-chip
```

### Step 2

Branches should always represent features. Features shouldn't have overlapping code.

To create a new branch and then move into that new branch:

```
git co -b <feature>
```

To make sure you are on the right branch:

```
git branch
```

Switch branch with:

```
git checkout <branch name>
```

### Step 3

Save your work frequently!

```
git add .
git commit -m "<fix, feat, docs, style, refactor>: <description>"
git push
```

### Step 4

Submit pull requests when your feature is finished. Select LeoLu0602 as the reviewer. Solve merge conflicts with the reviewer if there are any. Hope there won't be many. ðŸ¤ž
